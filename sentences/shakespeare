Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
You speak an infinite deal of nothing.
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come.
Conscience doth make cowards of us all.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast;
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face!
Some are born great, others achieve greatness.
Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
Better be a witty fool, than a foolish wit.
Are you sure that we are awake?
It seems to me that yet we sleep, we dream.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.
Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds.
I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent
Life is a paradise to what we fear of death.
